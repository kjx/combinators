# combinators
Parser Combinators and Grammar  and other experiments in and for Grace (specifically the Kernan interpreter)

In particular
  - collections and test-collection --- unfinihsed port of collcetions to Kernan.  Mostly tests not working I think.
  - test.grace - hacky port of part of minitest --- also unfinished
  - combinators.grace - a version of parser combinators
  - inheritator.grace and inheritiator-test.grace --- unfinished model of inheritance
